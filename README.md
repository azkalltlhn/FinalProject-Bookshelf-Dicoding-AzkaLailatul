# Bookshelf App Starter Project

This project is the Final Project from Dicoding Indonesia in the course Belajar Membuat Front-End Web untuk Pemula. It is a web-based application called Bookshelf App, created to help users manage their personal reading list in a simple yet structured way. The application enables users to add new books by filling in details such as the title, author, year of publication, and whether the book has been completed. Once added, the books are displayed in one of two sections—“Not Completed Yet” or “Completed”—depending on their reading status. To make it easier for users to manage their collection, the application also provides a search feature to quickly find books by title.

Beyond its core features, the project includes interactive modals that enhance the user experience. The Edit Book modal allows users to update existing information, the Completion Confirmation modal ensures intentional status changes when marking a book as finished, and the Delete Confirmation modal prevents accidental deletions. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates a practical implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in a front-end web environment. As a final project for the Dicoding course, it not only fulfills the given requirements but also serves as a portfolio piece that reflects the fundamental skills of front-end web development.
