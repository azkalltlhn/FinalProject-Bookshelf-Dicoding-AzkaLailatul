# Bookshelf App Starter Project

This project is a simple web-based application called Bookshelf App, designed to help users manage their personal reading list in a structured and interactive way. The application allows users to add new books by entering the title, author, year of publication, and selecting whether the book has been completed or not. Once added, the books are automatically displayed in one of two separate sections: “Not Completed Yet” and “Completed”, depending on their status. To make it easier for users to navigate through their collection, the application also provides a search feature that filters books based on their titles.

In addition to these basic functions, the application offers interactive modals that enhance user experience. The Edit Book modal allows users to update the details of an existing book. The Confirmation modal for completion appears when a user wants to mark a book as finished, ensuring that the change is intentional. Likewise, the Delete Confirmation modal ensures that books are not removed accidentally, requiring users to confirm before deletion. By integrating HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality, this project provides a simple yet complete experience for managing books digitally. It is designed to be easy to use, beginner-friendly, and a practical exercise in building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a front-end web application.
